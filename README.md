# Functional Tests on Cypress - Purchasing on Amazon
Hi there,

This was my first code develop to practice what I've learnt about [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

The system to be tested is the web page of the famous online store Amazon.
Tools that I used: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Node.JS, [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) e Linguagem Javascript, 

# Summary:
The tests have files containing the user's data which are required to execute the tests and a file to execute the whole purchasing process validated by the test, the tests are separated by the following test cases:

Access the web page
Login the page
Insert user's email
Insert user's password
Search Item
Select Item
Add item to the cart
Confirm order
Add credit card
Insert credit card data
Confirm payment method
Confirm delivery address
Checkout order
At the end of the test, Cypress creates a log that shows the tests executed on the browser. The whole test took 45 seconds.

I've created this repository to share how I executed this test case using Cypress. Feel free to share or report any issue.

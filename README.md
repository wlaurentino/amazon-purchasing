# Functional Tests on Cypress - Purchasing on Amazon
Hi there,

This was my first code develop to practice what I've learnt about Cypress [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

The system to be tested is the web page of the famous online store Amazon.
Tools that I used: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Node.JS, [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) e Linguagem Javascript, 

# Summary:
The tests has files containig the user's data which are required to execute the tests and a file to execute the whole purchasing process validaded by the test, the tests are separed by the following test cases:
-   Access the web page
-   Login the page
-   Insert user's email
-   Insert user's password
-   Search Item
-   Select Item
-   Add item in the cart
-   Confirm order
-   Add credit card
-   Insert credit card's data
-   Confirm payment method
-   Confirm delivery address
-   Checkout order

In the end of the test, Cypress creates a log that shows the tests executed on browser. The whole test took 45 seconds. 

I've created this repository to share how I executed this test case using Cypress. Feel free to share or report any issue.
